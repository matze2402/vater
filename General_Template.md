### General Remarks & Comments
Please see the project site https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO, the bfo2 owl discussion group http://groups.google.com/group/bfo-owl-devel, the bfo2 discussion group http://groups.google.com/group/bfo-devel, the tracking google doc http://goo.gl/IlrEE, and the current version of the bfo2 reference http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/dev/bfo2-reference.docx. This ontology is generated from a specification at https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/tree/master/src/ontology/owl-group/specification/ and with the code that generates the OWL version in https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/tree/master/src/tools/. A very early version of BFO version 2 in CLIF is at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/dev/bfo.clif.
This BFO 2.0 version represents a major update to BFO and is not strictly backwards compatible with BFO 1.1. The previous OWL version of BFO, version 1.1.1 will remain available at http://ifomis.org/bfo/1.1 and will no longer be updated. The BFO 2.0 OWL is a classes-only specification. The incorporation of core relations has been held over for a later version.
