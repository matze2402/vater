## Comments

The M3 Ontology can be considered more of a Taxonomy as it lacks definitions, sets up several equivalences which are neither well defined nor well hierarchically structured. Not really reusable. Some of the classes such as "Phosphorous" also seem to be out of place in a Internet of things Ontology , espaccially if they are not well defined (limited by a definition). The Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) Ontology is a unified language, nomenclature, dictionnary which enables semantically annotating heterogeneous IoT data produced by heterogeneous devices measurements (sensors, RFID tags, etc.)
